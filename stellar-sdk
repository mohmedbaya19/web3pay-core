Every wallet created through Web3Pay is linked to a unique digital identifier (userId) that represents the user within the system. This identifier may be:

- An encrypted email address  
- A symbolic ID within the Web3Pay ecosystem  
- Or a digital signature from another wallet  

> The goal is to ensure full symbolic ownership for the user without relying on traditional personal data.
