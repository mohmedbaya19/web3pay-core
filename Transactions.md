  "from": "GXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "to": "GYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY",
  "amount": "10.5",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "userId": "symbolic ID of sender",
  "timestamp": 1694371200000
}
`

📦 Storage Method

- Transactions are stored locally or optionally synced to a decentralized ledger.
- Each transaction is linked to the sender’s symbolic identity (userId).
- No personal data is stored or exposed.

📎 Identity Binding

All transactions are symbolically owned and traceable via userId. This ensures:

- Transparent history per symbolic user.
- No reliance on centralized identity systems.
- Full sovereignty over transaction records.

> Web3Pay treats every transaction as a symbolic proof of intent and ownership
